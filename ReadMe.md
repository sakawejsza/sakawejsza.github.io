The C++ file main.cpp asks you to input a string of text without line breaks
then it will ask for the number of characters allowed on each line. 
Then the program will print the text you enter while keeping within the limit for each line.

The Ruby file main.rb file already has the needed inputs, an array 2,4,6,10 and
will look at the array to determine if/ what the missing number in the sequence is. in this case the missing number is 8 so 8 will be the output.

The Perl file main.pl is simply a code code that prints the array in this case the array is a,b,c,d

The Python file main.py asks for a integer for a and z and then swaps the values for the two and prints the outcome
